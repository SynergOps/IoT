## Arduino Starter Kit - Topic-Based Learning Structure

This repository contains organized learning materials based on the Arduino Starter Kit curriculum, structured by topics for progressive learning.

### Folder Structure

```
├── 01_Basics/           - Introduction to Arduino and basic concepts
├── 02_Input/            - Input devices (buttons, potentiometers, sensors)
├── 03_Output/           - Output devices (LEDs, displays, buzzers)
├── 04_Sensors/          - Environmental and motion sensors
├── 05_Actuators/        - Motors, servos, and movement control
├── 06_Communication/    - Communication protocols (Serial, I2C, SPI, WiFi, Bluetooth)
└── 07_Projects/         - Complete integrated projects
```

### Learning Path

1. **01_Basics** - Start here to learn Arduino fundamentals, programming basics, and digital/analog I/O
2. **02_Input** - Learn to read from buttons, potentiometers, and other input devices
3. **03_Output** - Control LEDs, displays, and create visual/audio feedback
4. **04_Sensors** - Interface with temperature, light, motion, and other sensors
5. **05_Actuators** - Control motors, servos, and create movement
6. **06_Communication** - Connect devices and enable wireless communication
7. **07_Projects** - Apply your knowledge in complete, real-world projects

### Getting Started

Each folder contains:
- A README.md with topic overview and learning objectives
- Sample project descriptions
- Code examples and tutorials (to be added)
- Circuit diagrams and schematics (to be added)

### Prerequisites

- Arduino IDE installed ([Download here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software))
